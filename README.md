# Freshman Failure Prediction Model
As an Academic Interventionist, it is crucial to identify incoming freshmen that will struggle academically, and to do so early, quickly, and accurately. This project seeks to use historical data to develop a model that uses over 20 freshman characteristics to rank the liklihood that students will struggle in their first semester of high school.
