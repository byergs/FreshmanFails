# Freshman Failure Prediction Model

### Excel | Python | Power BI 

### How can we quickly identify and predict which incoming freshmen will struggle academically? Can we use demographic, assessment, course placement, and grade data to predict freshmen who will need additional support?

For school leaders and teachers, it is crucial to identify incoming freshmen who will struggle academically and to do so early, quickly, and accurately. Research clearly shows that one's freshman year is critical in the overall high school experience. This project seeks to use historical data to develop a model that uses over 20 freshman characteristics to rank the likelihood that students will struggle in their first semester of high school.
